## Core contributions
  1. A geometry consistency loss, which makes the predicted depths to be globally scale consistent.
  2. A self-discovered mask, which detects moving objects and occlusions effectively and efficiently.
  3. The scale-consistent predictions allow for doing Monocular Visual Odometry on long videos.

## Updates (Compared with NeurIPS version)
Note that this is an updated version, and you can find the original version in 'Release / NeurIPS Version' for reproducing the results reported in paper. Compared with NeurIPS version, we
(1) Change networks by using Resnet18 and Resnet50 pretrained model (on ImageNet) for depth and pose encoders.
(2) We add 'auto_mask' by Monodepth2 to remove stationary points.

We add training and testing on NYUv2 indoor depth dataset. See [Unsupervised-Indoor-Depth](https://github.com/JiawangBian/Unsupervised-Indoor-Depth) for details.


## Preamble
This codebase was developed and tested with python 3.6, Pytorch 1.0.1, and CUDA 10.0 on Ubuntu 16.04. It is based on [Clement Pinard's SfMLearner implementation](https://github.com/ClementPinard/SfmLearner-Pytorch).



## Prerequisite

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

or install manually the following packages :

```
torch >= 1.0.1
imageio
matplotlib
scipy
argparse
tensorboardX
blessings
progressbar2
path
```

It is also advised to have python3 bindings for opencv for tensorboard visualizations


## Datasets

See "scripts/run_prepare_data.sh".

    For KITTI Raw dataset, download the dataset using this script http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=raw_data_downloader.zip) provided on the official website.

    For KITTI Odometry dataset, download the dataset with color images.

Or you can download our pre-processed dataset from the following link

[kitti_256 (for kitti raw)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2g1zyXt4mCKNbpdiw?e=ZJAhIl) | [kitti_vo_256 (for kitti odom)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2k3YRX5Z8c_i7U5x7?e=ogw0c7) | [kitti_depth_test (eigen split)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2kz5Zy7jWZd2GyMR2?e=kBD4lb) | [kitti_vo_test (seqs 09-10)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiV6XqkxJHE2k0BSVZE-AJNvye9f?e=ztiSWp)


## Training

The "scripts" folder provides several examples for training and testing.

You can train the depth model on KITTI Raw by running
```bash
sh scripts/train_resnet18_depth_256.sh
```
or train the pose model on KITTI Odometry by running
```bash
sh scripts/train_resnet50_pose_256.sh
```
Then you can start a `tensorboard` session in this folder by
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=checkpoints/
```
and visualize the training progress by opening [https://localhost:6006](https://localhost:6006) on your browser. 



## Evaluation

You can evaluate depth on Eigen's split by running
```bash
sh scripts/test_kitti_depth.sh
```
evaluate visual odometry by running
```bash
sh scripts/test_kitti_vo.sh
```
and visualize depth by running
```bash
sh scripts/run_inference.sh
```
